		<p>Reviewing your posted opportunity, it got me interested, not justbecause the match of the required skill set, indeed, what call myattention the most was the description looking for a self-directed andstart-up spirit profile.Beyond to just be working to master a specific craft, for me, webdevelopment represents a multiplier to impact and transform oursurroundings, with a global influence!However, a global, digital broadcaster is useless without a purposebehind it. What really got me in this path was the unrelentingquestions about how can we do the most with the time is given to us,questioning if we were born to fill a cubicle, if life was meant to be‘average', living the script everybody accepted as 'normal'.Enquiries of this nature, in conjunction with the need to convey ideasin a powerful manner, is what fires and determines everything I doas web developer.On the other hand, if something thrills me about start-ups, is not onlythe lessons to follow when I begin my own, but the conviction that isone way -if not the only- to achieve ours, and others, greatestpotential, while being active agent of the impact one envision for theworld, profit is the side effect.My name is Pedro Ávila, and although born in Colombia, I believe inthe urge to promote a world citizen mindset. Also I'm eager to join adynamic talented team in which to grow. Please, feel free to reviewthe attached documentation, I'll be more than happy to answer anyquestion you might have.</p>

		<p>P.S. The photos you'll see in there belong to the sunset view frommy house, hope you enjoy them, don't hesitate in visit if you havenot already done so (and if you do, to come back) ;)All the best,Pedro Ávila.</p>
